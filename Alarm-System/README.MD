# Alarm System files for Home Assistant
* The alarm1.mp3 file is the mp3 file you need for the Alarm system in Home Assistant. 

You can download it and store it in your /config/www folder.

* In the config folder you will find the code that you can add to your configuration.yaml



The instructions to build your own alarm system can be found [in this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/JPSDAszlII4).
